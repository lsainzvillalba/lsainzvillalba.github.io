## Abstract
The use of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) for fluorescent guided malignant glioma surgery has proved to be useful to ensure a complete resection and thus, a best survival result. One report has described its usefulness for the detection of hemangioblastoma fragments at the cyst wall after apparently complete tumor resection. Von Hippel-Lindau disease patients suffer from many CNS hemangioblastomas, requiring multiple surgical procedures for resection of tumors, many times obscured because distorted structures and dense gliotic scars.
