External hydrocephalus (eHC) is commonly defined as a subtype of infant “hydrocephalus” consisting of macrocepahly 
associated with enlarged subarachnoid space and no or mild ventriculomegaly. This status is thought to be related to 
impaired CSF absorption because of arachnoid villi immaturity. However, other factors like the venous system might be 
involved in the development of the clinical picture. <br>
In this paper, we review a cohort of cases diagnosed with external hydrocephalus, that were evaluated with MR-phlebography 
and extract the correlation of venous findings with cortical subarachnoid volume.
