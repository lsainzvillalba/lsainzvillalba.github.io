## Abstract
Chronic overdrainage affects shunted patients producing a variety of symptoms that may be misdiagnosed. 
The best known symptoms are so-called shunt-related headaches. There is mounting evidence that changes 
in cerebrospinal venous system dynamics are a key factor to the pathophysiology of chronic overdrainage syndrome.
