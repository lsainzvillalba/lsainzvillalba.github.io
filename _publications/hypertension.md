## Abstract
External hydrocephalus (eHC) is commonly defined as a subtype of infant “hydrocephalus” consisting of macrocepahly associated with enlarged subarachnoid space and no or mild ventriculomegaly. This status is thought to be related to impaired CSF absorption because of arachnoid villi immaturity. However, other factors like the venous system might be involved in the development of the clinical picture.
