Right posterior parietal hemorhagic contrast enhancing mass

### HISTORY: 
<div style="text-align: justify"> 46 year old male who is brought to the emergency room presenting a sudden weakness of left leg. The neurological exam was ... </div> 

### DIAGNOSTIC STUDY: 
<div style="text-align: justify"> MRI brain showed right parietal parasagittal extra-axial contrast enhancing mass with a recent hemorrhage compatible with 
  a meningioma. The MRI further demonstrated that the superior sagittal sinus was patent but partially invaded. Additionally, the meningioma continued along the sagittal sinus following the transverse sinus and the sigmoid sinus, to the posterior fossa, where another small meningioma mass was present with no surrounding edema or compression.  </div>

### SURGICAL APPROACH:
Posterior parasagittal 

### POSITIONING: 
<div style="text-align: justify"> A Mayfield head clamp was applied. The patient was placed in supine position 
  with theÂ head and trunk slightly elevated . All pressure points were well-padded. The hair was clipped over the planned incision. 
  Pre-prepping was done with chlorhexidine solution. The electrophysiology monitoring team inserted needles in their proper locations and 
  baseline SSEPs and motor evoked potentials were obtained. The patient underwent co-registration of the 
  preoperative stereotactic MRI with his surface landmarks. </div> 

### OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE:
<div style="text-align: justify"> The area was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. A linear parietal incision, parallel to the coronal suture, was planned and infiltrated with lidocaine and opened sharply using a #21 scalpel blade. periostium disected separately and preserved in case of reconstruction.</div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> Right parietal parasagittal craniotomy was performed using an electric high speed drill. A burr-hole was placed at the anterior part of the frontospheoide suture (McCarthy) to expose both orbit and dura. After careful dissection of the periorbit from the superior orbital wall, the orbital roof was cut with the aid of a fine escoplo. The bone flap was uplifted utilizing a combination of #3 Penfield and Adson periosteal elevator with special care for the midline sagital sinus. 
  The dura was noted to be intact. The bone dust was irrigated and suctioned clean. A small C-shaped durotomy with base towards the 
  midline was performed and the dura was lifted with tenting sutures. </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> The operating microscope was then draped and brought into the operative field. Careful dissection 
  of the interhemispheric fissure was carried out anteriorly and posteriorly and down to the pericallosal cistern, letting the right 
  medial cortical surface lower by gravity. Cottonoids were placed on bridging cortical veins, the sagittal sinus and keeping and, 
  the medial surface of the superior frontal gyrus keeping them moist throughout the procedure. With the aid of the neuronavigational 
  probe, the limits of the tumor in the medial surface were identified. Microdissection technique was used further to expose the 
  cingulate sulcus and separate the callosomarginal artery cutting multiple arachnoid adhesions.  Under blue light and guided with 5-ALA 
  the medial surface of the tumor was visualized. A small corticectomy and tissue sample were centered at the most fluorescent spot 
  for intraoperative biopsy that confirmed high grade glioma. </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> The lesion was noted to be grayish in color with soft consistency and ill-defined planes. 
  Using a combination 7-French suction, bipolar electrocautery, as well as micro-scissors a plane was developed around the lesion 
  in its superior, medial border following the cingulate sulcus and 5-ALA signal. Microdissection continued around the lesion 
  following the plane and using the neuronavigational probe and the 5-ALA signal to carefully guide the volumetric resection. </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> The tumor specimen was sent to pathology. Before hemostasis was performed, vasospasm affecting a 
  small segment of the callosomarginal artery was noted and treated with irrigation of diluted nimodipin and body-temperature saline, 
  resolving completely in few minutes. The surgical bed was subsequently irrigated until clear hemostasis was achieved utilizing a 
  combination of bipolar electrocautery and oxidized cellulose absorbable hemostat (Surgicel). </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> The dura was subsequently closed with running non-absorbable braided 4-0 silk suture. 
  The bone was secured in place utilizing plates and screws. Periostium and subcutaneous layer were sutured with simple inverted 
  knots of 2-0 synthetic absorbable suture (Polysorb). The skin was then closed with an intradermal running absorbable suture 3-0 
  (Monosyn). A small silicon Blake drainage was placed in the subperiosteal space. A sterile head dressing was placed over the closed wound.</div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> Neurophysiological monitoring remained stable throughout the entire case. All sponge counts 
  and instrument counts were correct at the end of the case times two. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred 
  to the recovery room in stable condition.</div> 

### POSTOPERATIVE EVOLUTION: 
<div style="text-align: justify"> The patient awaken with no complications and with subjective improvement of both leg clumsiness 
  and slow thought. The walking pattern improved and the patient was socially more responsive as noted by his family. Postoperative 
  MRI showed gross total resection with no complications. Discharge was given at postoperative day 5 with appointments for oncological follow up. </div>

### NUANCES AND DECISION STRATEGY
- Extradural clinoidectomy - 
- Visual evoked potentials - before awake as a final result - later the eyelid will be swollen
- Check for middle clinoid
- T2 sequence - predicting consistency of tumor and natural subarachnoid spaces o and relationship to middle cerebral artery branches
- respect internal temporal muscle fascia  and do not cut a cuff to avoid atrophy and reattach it to the superior temporal line
