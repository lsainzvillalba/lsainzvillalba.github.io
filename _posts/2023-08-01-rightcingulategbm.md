## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right middle cingulate glioblastoma.
## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right middle cingulate glioblastoma.
## PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
1. Stereotactic parasagital right craniotomy approach with a resection of middle right cingulate mass.
2. Intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring of cranial nerves and brain auditory evoked responses.
3. Intraoperative use of microscope for microdissection.
4. 5 ALA guided microdissection

FINDINGS: Intraoperative biopsy by frozen section was consistent with Glioblastoma (WHO IV).
DRAINS: Blake small silicon drain.
COMPLICATIONS: None.

HISTORY: 79 year old male who presents with a history, symptoms and radiographic findings consistent with a right middle cingulate mass. 
DIAGNOSTIC STUDY: MRI brain showed right cingulate enhancing mass with MRI spectroscopy compatible with malignant glioma tumor.
SURGICAL RISKS: The patient was well apprised of all objectives, benefits, risks and potential complications of the procedure, including but not limited to: worsening of current status, the possible need for further procedures, the risk of infection, headaches, CSF leak, wound healing failure, seizures, hemorrhage, stroke, , coma and even death. Informed consent was obtained and secured after the patient voiced understanding of these risks and decided to proceed with the operation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE
POSITIONING: A Mayfield head clamp was applied. The patient was placed in the latero-supine position with the head tilted with the contralateral (left) side up. All pressure points were well-padded. The hair was clipped over the area where he was to undergo the incision. Pre-prepping was done with (chlorhexidine solution, alcohol). The electrophysiology monitoring team inserted needles in their proper locations and baseline SSEPs and motor evoked potentials were obtained. The patient underwent co-registration of the preoperative stereotactic MRI with (His/Her) surface landmarks. Accuracy was within 2mm.
Vital structure landmarks including the (torcula, confluence of sinuses and transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus) were identified and mapped out. The planned craniotomy was outlined according to the location of the foramen magnum tumor. 

OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE:
This area was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. A C-shaped postauricular incision was planned and infiltrated with (XX) % lidocaine with epinephrine and opened sharply using a # (XX) scalpel blade. The skin flap was reflected anteriorly and held in place utilizing the cerebellar retractor. The posterior nuchal muscles were dissected and incised from the superficial to the deep layers. This was carried out to expose C1 posterior arch and the occipital condyle. 
Retrosigmoid craniotomy was performed using a (pneumatic/ electric) high speed drill with a (XX) mm fluted burr. The bone flap was uplifted utilizing a combination of #3 Penfield and Adson periosteal elevator. The dura was noted to be (intact/with durotomy). Utilizing a high speed (electric/ pneumatic) drill and fluted (XX) mm burr, the posterolateral-most
portion of the  
occipital condyle and
jugular tubercle were removed. The bone dust was irrigated and suctioned clean. A small V-shaped durotomy was performed on the inferomedial dura. Careful dissection was carried down into the pontine-medullary cistern and the CSF drained out. The operating microscope was then draped with sterile drapes and brought into the operative field. Microdissection technique was carried out into the region of the lateral pontine-medullary cistern which was filled with multiple arachnoid adhesions. Continued microdissection and microsurgical techniques were used to clear these adhesions. The extracranial vertebral artery was noted to be penetrating through the dura. In between both vertebral arteries at the vertebrobasilar junction, the tumor was visualized. 
The lesion was noted to be (color, swelling, consistency, well-defined, ill-defined planes, dural attachments). Using a combination of 5 and 7-French suction, bipolar electrocautery, as well as micro-scissors and (CUSA) a plane was developed around the lesion and the lesion dissected in its anterior, posterior, medial and lateral borders. All visualized major blood vessels were preserved. Cranial nerves [IX, X XI, XII] were visualized and left intact. Again the neuronavigational probe was utilized to carefully guide the volumetric resection.
Throughout the resection, cranial nerve monitoring was carried out as well as the brain stem auditory evoked responses. Careful removal of the tumor was slowly accomplished by utilizing microsurgical techniques and bipolar electrocautery. The brain stem was noted to be well decompressed once the tumor was debulked. Cranial nerve monitoring remained stable throughout the entire case. The wound was subsequently irrigated until clear hemostasis was achieved utilizing a combination of bipolar electrocautery, oxidized cellulose absorbable hemostat (Surgicel) and absorbable gelatin compressed sponge (Gelfoam). IF FAT WILL BE USED: An incision was made in the
anterior        
lower quandrant part of the
abdomen. Fat was obtained and hemostasis promptly achieved. The fascia was approximated with (X)-0 polyglactin synthetic absorbable suture (Vicryl). The skin was closed with (nylon suture, skin-glue, steri-strips, surgical staples). A sterile dressing was placed over the closed wound. 
Several small pieces of fat were than packed around the remaining bit of tumor to allow a plane of fat between the brain stem and the anterior foramen magnum lesion. Tumor specimen was sent to pathology. The dura was subsequently closed utilizing a dural substitute patch and non-absorbable braided polyamide suture (Nurolon). The bone was secured in place utilizing plates and screws. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution. 

The nuchal musculature and fascia was approximated with 0 polyglactin synthetic absorbable suture (Vicryl). The galea was reapproximated with inverted interrupted (X)-0 polyglactin synthetic absorbable suture (Vicryl). The skin was then closed with (nylon suture, skin-glue, steri-strips, surgical staples). A sterile head dressing was placed over the closed wound.

All needle counts, sponge counts and instrument counts were correct at the end of the case times two. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.
