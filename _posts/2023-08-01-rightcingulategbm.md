### HISTORY: 
79 year old male who presents with a history, symptoms and radiographic findings consistent with a right middle cingulate mass. 

### DIAGNOSTIC STUDY: 
MRI brain showed right cingulate enhancing mass with MRI spectroscopy compatible with malignant glioma tumor.

### POSITIONING: 
A Mayfield head clamp was applied. The patient was placed in the latero-supine position with theÂ head tilted with the contralateral (left) side up. All pressure points were well-padded. The hair was clipped over the area where he was to undergo the incision. Pre-prepping was done with (chlorhexidine solution, alcohol). The electrophysiology monitoring team inserted needles in their proper locations and baseline SSEPs and motor evoked potentials were obtained. The patient underwent co-registration of the preoperative stereotactic MRI with his surface landmarks. The planned craniotomy was outlined parasagitally slightly crossing the midline. 

### OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE:
The area was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. A S-shaped coronal incision following previous old surgical incision was planned and infiltrated with lidocaine and opened sharply using a #21 scalpel blade. 

Right parasagital craniotomy was performed using a electric high speed drill. The bone flap was uplifted utilizing a combination of #3 Penfield and Adson periosteal elevator with special care for the midline sagital sinus. The dura was noted to be intact. The bone dust was irrigated and suctioned clean.
A small C-shaped durotomy with base towards the midline was performed on the inferomedial dura. Careful dissection of the interhemispheric fissure was carried down anteriorly and posteriorly to open the fissure and let the right medial cortical surface lower by gravity. Sponge cortical veins draining entrance to saggital sinus... protected with sponge and kept moist

The operating microscope was then draped with sterile drapes and brought into the operative field. Microdissection technique was carried out to expose the ... sulcus and the ... artery  multiple arachnoid adhesions. Continued microdissection and microsurgical techniques until cortical medial surface was exposed and 5ALA -> the tumor was visualized. center incision in 5ALA most enhancing spot - intraoperative biopsy

The lesion was noted to be grayish in color, of soft consistency and, ill-defined planes. Using a combination 7-French suction, bipolar electrocautery, as well as micro-scissors a plane was developed around the lesion in its superior, medial border. 

The neuronavigational probe and the 5-ALA signal were utilized to carefully guide the volumetric resection.

Neurophysiological monitoring remained stable throughout the entire case. The surgical bed was subsequently irrigated until clear hemostasis was achieved utilizing a combination of bipolar electrocautery and oxidized cellulose absorbable hemostat (Surgicel). Nimodipin para arteria

Tumor specimen was sent to pathology. The dura was subsequently closed with non-absorbable braided 4-0 silk suture. The bone was secured in place utilizing plates and screws. Periostio , Subcutaneous 2-0synthetic absorbable suture (Polysorb). The skin was then closed with an intradermal running absorbable suture 3-0 (Monosyn). A sterile head dressing was placed over the closed wound.

All sponge counts and instrument counts were correct at the end of the case times two. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.

### PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Right middle cingulate glioblastoma.
### POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Right middle cingulate glioblastoma.

### PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
1. Stereotactic parasagital right craniotomy approach with a resection of middle right cingulate mass.
2. Intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring of cranial nerves and brain auditory evoked responses.
3. Intraoperative use of microscope for microdissection.
4. 5-ALA guided microdissection

### FINDINGS: 
Intraoperative biopsy by frozen section was consistent with Glioblastoma (WHO IV).

### POSTOPERATIVE EVOLUTION: 

Discharge at postop day 5 with postop MRI gross total resection
