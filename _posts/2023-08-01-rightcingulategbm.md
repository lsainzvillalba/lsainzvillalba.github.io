### HISTORY: 
79 year old male who presents with a history, symptoms and radiographic findings consistent with a right middle cingulate mass. The neurological exam revealed sluggish train of thought with slow answering despite being oriented, subtle social and emotional apathy and slight weakness on left leg with clumsiness mostly affecting walk with spared strength in simple movements. 

### DIAGNOSTIC STUDY: 
MRI brain showed right cingulate enhancing mass with MRI spectroscopy compatible with malignant glioma tumor. Vasogenic edema spread up to superior frontal gyrus (F1) from superior border of caudate nucleus.

### SURGICAL APPROACH:
Interhemispheric ipsilateral transcingulate

### POSITIONING: 
A Mayfield head clamp was applied. The patient was placed in the latero-supine position with theÂ head tilted with the right side down. All pressure points were well-padded. The hair was clipped over the planned incision. Pre-prepping was done with chlorhexidine solution. The electrophysiology monitoring team inserted needles in their proper locations and baseline SSEPs and motor evoked potentials were obtained. The patient underwent co-registration of the preoperative stereotactic MRI with his surface landmarks. The planned craniotomy was outlined right parasagittal slightly crossing the midline. 

### OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE:
The area was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. A S-shaped coronal incision following previous surgical incision (for skin lesion) was planned and infiltrated with lidocaine and opened sharply using a #21 scalpel blade. Periosteum was preserved and cut separately for later closure.

Right parasagittal craniotomy was performed using an electric high speed drill. The bone flap was uplifted utilizing a combination of #3 Penfield and Adson periosteal elevator with special care for the midline sagital sinus. The dura was noted to be intact. The bone dust was irrigated and suctioned clean.
A small C-shaped durotomy with base towards the midline was performed and the dura was lifted contralateraly with tenting sutures.  

The operating microscope was then draped with sterile drapes and brought into the operative field. Careful dissection of the interhemispheric fissure was carried out anteriorly and posteriorly to open the fissure and down to the pericallosal cistern, letting the right medial cortical surface lower by gravity. Cottonoids were placed on bridging cortical veins and the sagittal sinus and keeping them moist throughout the procedure. With the aid of the neuronavigational probe, the limits of the tumor in the medial surface were identified. Microdissection technique was used further to expose the cingulate sulcus and separate the callosomarginal artery cutting multiple arachnoid adhesions.  and 5ALA -> the tumor was visualized. center incision in 5ALA most enhancing spot - intraoperative biopsy 

The lesion was noted to be grayish in color, of soft consistency and, ill-defined planes. Using a combination 7-French suction, bipolar electrocautery, as well as micro-scissors a plane was developed around the lesion in its superior, medial border following the cingulate sulcus. 

The neuronavigational probe and the 5-ALA signal were utilized to carefully guide the volumetric resection.

Neurophysiological monitoring remained stable throughout the entire case. The surgical bed was subsequently irrigated until clear hemostasis was achieved utilizing a combination of bipolar electrocautery and oxidized cellulose absorbable hemostat (Surgicel). Nimodipin para arteria

Tumor specimen was sent to pathology. The dura was subsequently closed with non-absorbable braided 4-0 silk suture. The bone was secured in place utilizing plates and screws. Periostio , Subcutaneous 2-0synthetic absorbable suture (Polysorb). The skin was then closed with an intradermal running absorbable suture 3-0 (Monosyn). A sterile head dressing was placed over the closed wound.

All sponge counts and instrument counts were correct at the end of the case times two. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.

### POSTOPERATIVE EVOLUTION: 

Discharge at postop day 5 with immediate postop MRI gross total resection

### NUANCES AND DECISION STRATEGY
- gravity aiding exposure
- bridging veins - plan craniotomy
- cortical entrance through affected gyrus sparing because of biological tumor spread and motor supplementary area
- dissection in advance of the callosomarginal artery before dissection to remove from sulcus - anatomical removal and avoid stroke
- 5 ALA guided resection - high suspicion of malignant glioma
- intraoperative neurophysiology - motor evoked potentials - corticospinal tract
