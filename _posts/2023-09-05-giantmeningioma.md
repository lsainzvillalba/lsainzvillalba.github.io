Large anterior falcine contrast enhancing mass

### HISTORY: 
<div style="text-align: justify"> 38 year old male who presents with a history of non-controlled severe headaches. He came to the emergency room suffering a severe headache episode. Radiographic findings were consistent with a large falcine mass. Besides subtle underperformance on daily cognitive tasks, the neurological exam was normal . </div> 

### DIAGNOSTIC STUDY: 
<div style="text-align: justify"> MRI brain showed large anterior falcine contrast enhancing mass compatible with 
  a meningioma with important mass effect and edema. </div>

### SURGICAL APPROACH:
Bicoronal Midline

### POSITIONING: 
<div style="text-align: justify"> A Mayfield head clamp was applied. The patient was placed in supine position 
  with theÂ head slightly flexed and elevated. Legs were also flexed and kept high, placing the bed axis such that the head stayed slightly below the level of the heart. All pressure points were well-padded. The hair was clipped over the planned incision. 
  Pre-prepping was done with chlorhexidine solution. The electrophysiology monitoring team inserted needles in their proper locations and 
  baseline SSEPs and motor evoked potentials were obtained. The patient underwent co-registration of the 
  preoperative stereotactic MRI with her surface landmarks. The craniotomy was outlined according to the registration to expose healthy duramater margins.</div> 

### OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE:
<div style="text-align: justify"> The area was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. A bicoronal incision behind the hair line and centered on the lesion was planned and infiltrated with lidocaine and opened sharply using a #21 scalpel blade. A large periostium flap was dissected separately and preserved for later reconstruction of the duramater. The scalp and the external table of the calvaria bone were noted as normal with no hypertrophic arteries.</div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> A large craniotomy centered over the midline and slighlty posterior to the coronal suture was performed using an electric high speed drill. Two burr-holes were placed at the edges of the craniotomy over the midline and in expected healthy duramater surface. With the help of a  #3 Penfield the duramater of the sagittal sinus was disected from the bone and the craniotomy was completed with the craniotome in two passes (from medial to lateral).The bone flap was uplifted utilizing a combination of #3 Penfield and Adson periosteal elevator with special care for the superior sagittal sinus. The dura was noted to have some tears with tumor components strongly adhered to the uplifted bone. A small C-shaped durotomy with base towards the 
  midline was performed and the dura was lifted with tenting sutures. </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> The operating microscope was then draped and brought into the operative field. Careful dissection 
  of the interhemispheric fissure was carried out anteriorly and posteriorly and down to the pericallosal cistern, letting the right 
  medial cortical surface lower by gravity. Cottonoids were placed on bridging cortical veins, the sagittal sinus and keeping and, 
  the medial surface of the superior frontal gyrus keeping them moist throughout the procedure. With the aid of the neuronavigational 
  probe, the limits of the tumor in the medial surface were identified. Microdissection technique was used further to expose the 
  cingulate sulcus and separate the callosomarginal artery cutting multiple arachnoid adhesions.  Under blue light and guided with 5-ALA 
  the medial surface of the tumor was visualized. A small corticectomy and tissue sample were centered at the most fluorescent spot 
  for intraoperative biopsy that confirmed high grade glioma. </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> The lesion was noted to be grayish in color with soft consistency and ill-defined planes. 
  Using a combination 5-French suction, bipolar electrocautery, as well as micro-scissors a plane was developed around the lesion 
  in its superior, medial border following the cingulate sulcus and 5-ALA signal. Microdissection continued around the lesion 
  following the plane and using the neuronavigational probe and the 5-ALA signal to carefully guide the volumetric resection. </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> The tumor specimen was sent to pathology. body-temperature saline, The surgical bed was subsequently irrigated until clear hemostasis was achieved utilizing a 
  combination of bipolar electrocautery and oxidized cellulose absorbable hemostat (Surgicel). </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> Periostium reconstruction to cover the duramater defect ... closed with running non-absorbable braided 4-0 silk suture. 
  Bone drilling of internal table until healthy bone was noted. The bone was secured in place utilizing plates and screws. Subcutaneous layer was sutured with simple inverted 
  knots of 2-0 synthetic absorbable suture (Polysorb). The skin was then closed with an intradermal running absorbable suture 3-0 
  (Monosyn). A small silicon Blake drainage was placed in the subperiosteal space. A sterile head dressing was placed over the closed wound.</div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> Neurophysiological monitoring remained stable throughout the entire case. All sponge and instrument counts were correct at the end of the case times two. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred 
  to the recovery room in stable condition.</div> 

### POSTOPERATIVE EVOLUTION: 
Meningioma WHO II

### POSTOPERATIVE EVOLUTION: 
<div style="text-align: justify"> The patient awaken with no complications and with subjective improvement of pressure feeling and headache. Postoperative 
  CT showed gross total resection with no complications. Dexamethasone and Levetiracetam were maintained for several weeks and discontinued slower than in standard cases due to removal of giant tumor (>60mm in diameter) that produces drastic change in intracranial pressure and potential exacerbated edema. Discharge was given at postoperative day 7 with appointments for follow up. </div>

### NUANCES AND DECISION STRATEGY
- CT bone - study abnormal anatomy of affected bone and venous drainage - diploic veins anatomy - prepare blood transfusion hemostats
- MRI - study vasculature of scalp and duramater that may feed the tumor - prevent important hemorrhage during craniotomy
-  Preoperative venous sequence MRI to study the venous system - patency occlusion of venous sinus and developed collaterals pathways
-  Avoid sacrifice of patent venous collaterals pathways - hypertrophic inferior sagital sinus
- T2 sequence - predicting consistency of tumor and relationship neurovascular structures like the cingulate and pericallosal arteries
- Appropriate hidration and corticoid and antiepileptic medication - drastic change of pressure and decompresion
