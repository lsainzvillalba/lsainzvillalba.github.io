Intramedullary contrast enhancing lesion

# In progress ...

### HISTORY: 
<div style="text-align: justify"> 52 year old female presents with a history of backpain and increasing paresthesias in both feet. Radiographic findings were consistent with a dorsal intradural intramedullary mass. The neurological exam was normal besides subjective paresthesias in both S1 root dermatomas.No hyposthesias or abnormal bladder or bowel function were noted. Strength was also noted as normal by groups with no walking abnormalities. </div> 

### DIAGNOSTIC STUDY: 
<div style="text-align: justify"> Dorsal MRI showed contrast enhancing mass compatible with 
  a hemangioblastoma... </div>

### SURGICAL APPROACH:
...

### POSITIONING: 
<div style="text-align: justify"> The patient was placed in prone position 
  with t. All pressure points were well-padded. Control escopia of level of interest. 
  Pre-prepping was done with chlorhexidine solution. The electrophysiology monitoring team inserted needles in their proper locations and 
  baseline SSEPs and motor evoked potentials were obtained-  baseline slight decrease of both sides sseps. </div> 

### OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE:
<div style="text-align: justify"> The area was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. A midline incision one level above and below and opened sharply using a #21 scalpel blade. scle during the operation. Subcutaneous , muscle fascia, interespinous ligament </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> Kerrison #3 , craniotome to complete the lamina cut preplaced screws and plates. The bone flap was uplifted utilizing a  of #3 Penfield with special care with the duramater. The dura was noted to be intact. The bone dust was irrigated and suctioned clean.  </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> The operating microscope was then draped and brought into the operative field.A midline linear durotomy was performed and the dura was lifted laterally to both sides with tenting sutures. electrode proximal ... Root dissection, identify and dissect drainage pial veins and arteries - The lesion was noted to be reddish in color with soft consistency and clear-defined planes. 
  Using a combination 5-French suction, bipolar electrocautery, as well as micro-scissors a plane was developed around the lesion  coagulate and shrink surface, dissect pial plane, copious irrigation to avoid bipolar electrocautery . Microdissection technique was used further to delimitate separate and coagulate tumoral surface from the healthy spinal cord - remove en bloc </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> The tumor specimen was sent to pathology. The surgical bed was subsequently irrigated until clear hemostasis was achieved with no electrocautery.The dura was subsequently closed with running non-absorbable braided 4-0 silk suture. The laminae were secured in place at each level utilizing plates and screws. Muscle was approximated to the midline and anchored to the spinous process. Fascia muscle attached to interspinous ligament that was resutured both proximally and distally . Periostium and subcutaneous layer were sutured with simple inverted 
  knots of 2-0 synthetic absorbable suture (Polysorb). The skin was then closed with an intradermal running absorbable suture 3-0 
  (Monosyn). </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> Neurophysiological monitoring remained stable throughout the entire case. All sponge and instrument counts were correct at the end of the case times two. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred 
  to the recovery room in stable condition.</div> 

### POSTOPERATIVE EVOLUTION: 
<div style="text-align: justify"> The patient awaken with no complications. Postoperative MRI showed gross total resection with no complications. Paresthesias persisted through out the immediate postoperative period and slowly diminished in intensity. Discharge was given at postoperative day 5 with appointments for oncological follow up. </div>

### NUANCES AND DECISION STRATEGY
- preserve interspinous ligament, reattach fascial plane to it
- fascial plane in one running suture - avoid pseudomeningocele csf fisula leak
- replace laminae with plates and screws - avoid pseudomeningocele
- neurophysiology
- identify pial arteries feeding tumor and venous drainage - leave to the end
- - remove en bloc do not attempt debulking, biopsy or piecemeal resection with hemangioblastomas unless really needed - bleeding
- no drainage - avoid pseudomeningocele
