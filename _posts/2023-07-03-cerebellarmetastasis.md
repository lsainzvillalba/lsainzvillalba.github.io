Cerebellar contrast enhancing mass in a lung cancer patient

# In progress ...

### HISTORY: 
<div style="text-align: justify"> 43 year old female who is brought to the emergency room after suffering an episode of epileptic seizures. Radiographic findings were consistent with a left clinoidal mass. The neurological exam was normal. </div> 

### DIAGNOSTIC STUDY: 
<div style="text-align: justify"> MRI brain showed left clinoidal extra-axial contrast enhancing mass compatible with 
  a meningioma. </div>

### SURGICAL APPROACH:
Extended-pterional with extradural clinoidectomy

### POSITIONING: 
<div style="text-align: justify"> A Mayfield head clamp was applied. The patient was placed in supine position 
  with theÂ head slightly rotated (about 30 degrees) towards the right and extended such that the malar prominence would be the highest point
  in the surgical field. All pressure points were well-padded. The hair was clipped over the planned incision. 
  Pre-prepping was done with chlorhexidine solution. The electrophysiology monitoring team inserted needles in their proper locations and 
  baseline SSEPs, motor evoked potentials and, visual evoked potentials were obtained. The patient underwent co-registration of the 
  preoperative stereotactic MRI with her surface landmarks. </div> 

### OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE:
<div style="text-align: justify"> The area was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. A fronto-pterional incision from the midline to the root of the zygoma, behind the hair line was planned and infiltrated with lidocaine and opened sharply using a #21 scalpel blade. Temporal muscle dissection was performed in two steps: interfascially below the frontal fat pad and then subperiostically to allow wider exposure and less tension on the muscle during the operation.</div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> Left pterioral craniotomy was performed using an electric high speed drill with the frontal cut extending to the superior orbital rim lateral to the supraorbital nerve.A burr-hole was placed at the anterior part of the frontospheoide suture (McCarthy) to expose both orbit and dura. After careful dissection of the periorbit from the superior orbital wall, the orbital roof was cut with the aid of a fine escoplo. The bone flap was uplifted utilizing a combination of #3 Penfield and Adson periosteal elevator with special care for the midline sagital sinus. 
  The dura was noted to be intact. The bone dust was irrigated and suctioned clean. A small C-shaped durotomy with base towards the 
  midline was performed and the dura was lifted with tenting sutures. </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> The operating microscope was then draped and brought into the operative field. Careful dissection 
  of the interhemispheric fissure was carried out anteriorly and posteriorly and down to the pericallosal cistern, letting the right 
  medial cortical surface lower by gravity. Cottonoids were placed on bridging cortical veins, the sagittal sinus and keeping and, 
  the medial surface of the superior frontal gyrus keeping them moist throughout the procedure. With the aid of the neuronavigational 
  probe, the limits of the tumor in the medial surface were identified. Microdissection technique was used further to expose the 
  cingulate sulcus and separate the callosomarginal artery cutting multiple arachnoid adhesions.  Under blue light and guided with 5-ALA 
  the medial surface of the tumor was visualized. A small corticectomy and tissue sample were centered at the most fluorescent spot 
  for intraoperative biopsy that confirmed high grade glioma. </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> The lesion was noted to be grayish in color with soft consistency and ill-defined planes. 
  Using a combination 7-French suction, bipolar electrocautery, as well as micro-scissors a plane was developed around the lesion 
  in its superior, medial border following the cingulate sulcus and 5-ALA signal. Microdissection continued around the lesion 
  following the plane and using the neuronavigational probe and the 5-ALA signal to carefully guide the volumetric resection. </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> The tumor specimen was sent to pathology. Before hemostasis was performed, vasospasm affecting a 
  small segment of the callosomarginal artery was noted and treated with irrigation of diluted nimodipin and body-temperature saline, 
  resolving completely in few minutes. The surgical bed was subsequently irrigated until clear hemostasis was achieved utilizing a 
  combination of bipolar electrocautery and oxidized cellulose absorbable hemostat (Surgicel). </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> The dura was subsequently closed with running non-absorbable braided 4-0 silk suture. 
  The bone was secured in place utilizing plates and screws. Periostium and subcutaneous layer were sutured with simple inverted 
  knots of 2-0 synthetic absorbable suture (Polysorb). The skin was then closed with an intradermal running absorbable suture 3-0 
  (Monosyn). A small silicon Blake drainage was placed in the subperiosteal space. A sterile head dressing was placed over the closed wound.</div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> Neurophysiological monitoring remained stable throughout the entire case. All sponge counts 
  and instrument counts were correct at the end of the case times two. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred 
  to the recovery room in stable condition.</div> 

### POSTOPERATIVE EVOLUTION: 
<div style="text-align: justify"> The patient awaken with no complications and with subjective improvement of both leg clumsiness 
  and slow thought. The walking pattern improved and the patient was socially more responsive as noted by his family. Postoperative 
  MRI showed gross total resection with no complications. Discharge was given at postoperative day 5 with appointments for oncological follow up. </div>

### NUANCES AND DECISION STRATEGY
- 
- Extradural clinoidectomy - 
- Visual evoked potentials - before awake as a final result - later the eyelid will be swollen
- Check for middle clinoid
- T2 sequence - predicting consistency of tumor and natural subarachnoid spaces o and relationship to middle cerebral artery branches
- respect internal temporal muscle fascia  and do not cut a cuff to avoid atrophy and reattach it to the superior temporal line
-
