Cerebellar contrast enhancing mass in a patient with lung cancer

# In progress ...

### HISTORY: 
<div style="text-align: justify"> 57 year old male with treated lung cancer presents with history of dizziness and headaches. The neurological exam revealed right-sided dysmetria in finger to finger and finger to nose tests, slight inbalance in Romberg test and subjective instability during walking. </div> 

### DIAGNOSTIC STUDY: 
<div style="text-align: justify"> MRI brain showed infratentorial cerebellar contrast enhancing mass, heterogenous with surrounding edema, compatible with 
  a malignant tumor, probably metastasis in the history context of the patient </div>

### SURGICAL APPROACH:
Infratentorial transcortical

### POSITIONING: 
<div style="text-align: justify"> A Mayfield head clamp was applied. The patient was placed in prone position 
  with theÂ head slightly flexed in concorde. All pressure points were well-padded. The hair was clipped over the planned incision. 
  Pre-prepping was done with chlorhexidine solution. The electrophysiology monitoring team inserted needles in their proper locations and 
  baseline SSEPs and motor evoked potentials were obtained. The patient underwent co-registration of the 
  preoperative stereotactic MRI with his surface landmarks. </div> 

### OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE:
<div style="text-align: justify"> The area was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. A midline incision from lambda to the C2 prominence was infiltrated with lidocaine and opened sharply using a #21 scalpel blade. Periostial - nucal midline  side dissection of fascial plane, midline avoiding cautery of muscle, preserving C2 insertion muscle, dissecting posterior arch of C1, careful lateral dissection - identification of superior and inferior nucal line- Kerrison bone punch 2mm for inferior border of occipital bone foramen magnum .</div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> Two small burr-holes at both sides of the occipital sinus ?? craniotomy two down-ward lateral passes and then connected both with kerrison rongeurs. After careful dissection of the periorbit from the superior orbital wall, the orbital roof was cut with the aid of a 5mm chisel. The bone flap was uplifted utilizing with care for remanent sinus. </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> The operating microscope was then draped and brought into the operative field. A U- shaped dura incision was performed with base towards the transverse sinus and the dura tented upwards - arachnoid adhesions supracerebellar surface space - Corticectomy depth grayish lesion, soft consistency and ill defined borders - dissection to delimitate borders of tumor bipolar , ultrasonic aspirator . </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> The tumor specimen was sent to pathology. The surgical bed was subsequently irrigated until clear hemostasis was achieved utilizing a combination of bipolar electrocautery and oxidized cellulose absorbable hemostat (Surgicel). </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> The dura was subsequently closed with running non-absorbable braided 4-0 silk suture. 
  The bone was secured in place utilizing plates and screws. Approximation of muscle ? and attached to the plates in the occipital bone ... Periostium along with nucal line ligaments were closed in a single plane with a running suture of 2-0 synthetic absorbable suture (Polysorb). Subcutaneous plane was closed with inverted single knots of the same suture type. The skin was then closed with an intradermal running absorbable suture 3-0 (Monosyn).A sterile head dressing was placed over the closed wound.</div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> Neurophysiological monitoring remained stable throughout the entire case. All sponge counts 
  and instrument counts were correct at the end of the case times two. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred 
  to the recovery room in stable condition.</div> 

### POSTOPERATIVE EVOLUTION: 
Lung Cancer Epidermoid Metastasis

### POSTOPERATIVE EVOLUTION: 
<div style="text-align: justify"> The patient awaken with no complications and with subjective improvement of both leg clumsiness 
  and slow thought. The walking pattern improved and the patient was socially more responsive as noted by his family. Postoperative 
  MRI showed gross total resection with no complications. Discharge was given at postoperative day 5 with appointments for oncological follow up. </div>

### NUANCES AND DECISION STRATEGY
- avoid pseudomeningocele - suture nucal ligament and attachment to plate
- periostium scalp and nucal ligament and fascia in one plane - running suture
- U shape to avoid pseudomeningocele and tenting dura moist to suture it again without patch
- kerrison foramem magnum thickened duramater  venous sinus
