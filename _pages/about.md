## Hello,

<div style="text-align: justify"> welcome to my personal webpage. I am a certified (FEBNS) Neurosurgeon, passionate about Keyhole and Awake surgical techniques, Neuro-oncology, Functional and Pediatric Neurosurgery as well as Cognitive Neuroscience research to provide breakthroughs in understanding healthy and pathological states of the brain. </div> 
<div style="text-align: justify"> I completed my Medicine studies at the Complutense University of Madrid (Spain) in 2012 and then became a fully trained and certified Neurosurgeon at the Jiménez Díaz Hospital in Madrid (Spain). I also completed a second major degree in Theoretical Physics at the same university.</div> 
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify"> I am currently finishing a PhD in Computational Neuroscience at the Institute of Neuroinformatics (ETH Zurich). </div>
